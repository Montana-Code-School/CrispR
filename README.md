# CrispR

###Team Tomato Presents: CrispR

######Crispr connects the busy consumer with the world of the local farmer through a simple, yet timeless medium: good food.  

Crispr takes the unfamiliar and increasingly diverse selection of items
found at your local farmers market and distills them down into a list
of what you need to get for dinner.  In the past twenty years farmers
markets in the united states have increased by 7 fold.  These are strong
economic indicators, they represent depth of community and resilient,
long lasting change.

Next time you need to shop, take your bike, run to your local market.
Meet the people that grow your food and take crisper with you.

We use MongoDB to construct our backend and move our data around.  Our data router is mongoose.
The frontend is comprised primarily of ReactJS with a skeleton framework of HTML.
jQuery Ajax calls are used to bring data in from the API which you can find here:  http://food2fork.com/about/api

If you'd like to check out any of the code, feel free to look around.

The end.
